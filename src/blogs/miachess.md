Heya! In the last few days, fraille and I have been working on a Minecraft chess board with custom 3D models as chess pieces. ♟️

As we wanted to add this to our little village on [Mine in Abyss](https://mineinabyss.com/), a Minecraft Server, we focused on making a texture pack to make this work. We are happy to present **MIA Chess**, a mini game in Matsuka Village!

People who visit us here at Matsuka in Layer 4 can now play the game by downloading the texture pack:

We hope to see you in Matsuka!
